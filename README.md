## Third-party fonts

This website uses the following fonts:

- **MixSerifCondense**, a 16px bitmap font by Cão Fila Lettering. Probably most well known for its use in Deltarune Chapter 4's prophecy panes. From what I can tell, looking on multiple font download sites, it is free for both commercial and non-commercial use. Download it here: https://www.dafont.com/mixserifcondense.font
