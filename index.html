				<h1>This is Sparronator9999.</h1>
				<p>I write programs to fix my tech problems, among other things. My main programming language is C#, which I have been using since 2019 (when I first learnt it for school). I am also studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at university, which I am currently in my second year of.</p>
				<p>As of September 2025, I have written more than 60 programs in C# since learning it, from failed projects/drafts, to copied tutorials for school programming classes, to clones of simple games with varying quality (think games like Pong or Minesweeper), to full-featured apps that get published to <a href="https://github.com/Sparronator9999">my GitHub</a>. One of those projects (and my first public one), <a href="https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC">YAMDCC</a>, has gained a fair following since it was published to GitHub in 2024.</p>
				<p>I can also write webpages with "raw" HTML/CSS/JS, no website builder needed.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<p>That not enough for you? Here's some of the things I've put on the internet:</p>
				<h2>I code.</h2>

						<div class="card-desc">
							<h2><a href="https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC">YAMDCC</a></h2>
							<p>The first project I ever released on GitHub. It, among other things, controls the fan speed of MSI laptops. I originally wrote it ~mid-2023 to control my own laptop's fans and charge limit, but decided in 2024 to clean up the code and publish it to GitHub. Since then it has gained a moderate following of <a href="https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC/stargazers">over 100 stars</a>.</p>

						<div class="card-desc">
							<h2><a href="https://github.com/Sparronator9999/OpenBootCamp">OpenBootCamp (OBC)</a></h2>
							<p>Basically YAMDCC for Apple computers at this point, but with special Fn key handling. Created to fix bugs with special Fn keys under regular Boot Camp Assistant (from not remembering the keyboard backlight brightness, to straight up not working at all), but has since evolved to include fan control and battery charge limiting (hence "YAMDCC for Apple computers"). Config GUI is still a WIP, mainly due to the fact this project is much less popular than YAMDCC.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://github.com/Sparronator9999/RefreshRateTuner">Refresh Rate Tuner</a></h2>
							<p>A very simple app that changes your laptop display's refresh rate based on whether it's plugged in or not. Written in response to a YAMDCC feature request. I personally have no use for this app, as none of my computers have a display refresh rate of over 60 Hz.</p>

				<h2>I cover (occasionally).</h2>
				<p><a href="https://odysee.com/@Sparronator9999:e">My Odysee channel</a> hosts MIDI covers of Deltarune music (specifically from Chapters 3+4). I started covering music from that game because <a href="https://www.netcavy.net">ShinkoNetCavy</a> was taking too long, and I needed a break from coding. Here's my latest one (as of writing):</p>

				<p>As of writing, there are only two public covers, but I have 5 in various stages of completion. There is no upload schedule, but I'll try to keep it every 1-2 months, until I run out of songs I want to cover.</p>
